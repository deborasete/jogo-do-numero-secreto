# Welcome to the Secret Number Challenge!

# How to play:
1) Try to guess the secret number: Enter a number between 1 and 10 in the input field.
2) Get tips: If your guess is incorrect, we'll give you a tip whether the secret number is higher or lower than the number you entered.
3) Keep trying: You can try as many times as you want until you guess the secret number. At the end, you will see how many attempts were possible to get it right!

Have fun: This game is a fun way to challenge your logic and intuition! Good luck!
